Please see contact info at the end of this writeup. ***\n\nSkye is a gorgeous 2 year old Pitbull Terrier. She was abandoned by her family in a high kill shelter in Southern CA because they were moving. Skye is a 65 pound lap dog, she loves to snuggle, give kisses, chase butterflies, play fetch and go on long walks or runs (she would be a great running partner). \n\nSkye is dog selective which means she likes some dogs and not others so she would probably be best as an only pet. She is very sweet, but large and active so we recommend no children younger than 10 years old. No cats. Skye spent a very long time in the shelter and is still young so she will need some training. \n\nSkye is spayed, microchipped, vaccinated and ready for her forever home.  If you are interested in meeting Skye or would like to find out more about her, please contact Adrienne at a_ledden@yahoo.com"

Chihuahua mix whose ruggedly handsome good looks make us think heâ\u0080\u0099s half-German Shepherd! He had a rough start in life as a clearly abused stray on the streets of Los Angeles and was frantic and aggressive by the time he arrived at SFACC more than three years ago.  He actually was in the room to be euthanized, but at the last minute gave the attendants an attack of kisses, letting them know he was just stressed out!  In his adopterâ\u0080\u0099s home he progressed greatly, bonding quickly and deeply with both his owner and with vacation sitters/boarding facilities as a super-affectionate companion dog and playmate. \n\nHarold is highly intelligent and energetic and loves to go for walks and play - especially fetch or tug-of-war with a ball or toy.  Whenever you come home or even disappear to do work in another room for an hour, your return will be greeted with excitement, hugs and kisses!  He is housebroken currently has a dog door and fenced yard, where he loves to lie in the sun and supervise gardening. Harold is an excellent guard dog who sounds bigger than he is, and prefers to sleep in bed with you so he can protect you at night!  His fur is so short and he loves the sun so much, he never smells or needs a bath!  \n\nHarold loves children, but they need to be old enough to understand his limitations.  He is good with most other small dogs after a proper introduction, and is friends with many larger dogs after a rocky first meeting.  Despite his affectionate side, he is a fearful dog and shows aggression toward unknown larger dogs and some people on walks, and currently cannot go off-leash. \n\nHarold respects and does well with confident, dog-experienced cats, but will chase more timid cats. Harold would probably do best as the only animal in a household where someone is at home frequently - his current owner is at home approximately four days a week. Harold really is a wonderful soul, a super-loyal and devoted companion who just needs to find his right person! There are facilities in both SF and the East Bay that know and will board/take him for daycare.\n\nA two-week in-home â\u0080\u009ctest driveâ\u0080\u009d with Harold is strongly encouraged.  If interested, please email skorpiosf@gmail.com  and let us know about your living situation/interest in Harold. Thank you!"

                        "$t": "Davey!  You met him in January when he came to Grateful Dogs Rescue with two diseased eyes.   Both of his eyes were in such bad shape that they had to be removed\n\nDavey is a spunky, curious, very loving and affectionate \n\nSince his surgery, he has blossomed into the most adorable, alert, happy little fellow. He loves to play with squeaky and chew toys, and immediately found the toy bowl at his foster home! \n\nDavey gets along well with the other dogs in his foster home, and has learned to live with a cat. As he has grown familiar with the lay of the land at his foster home, he navigates the house and the yard much like a sighted dog - however - he will need a special owner that can provide a lifetime of protection for him.  \n\nDavey loves to join the pack on daily walks.  He's trots along with everyone else.  And Davey plays with the other pups in the home. He loves to roll around and wrestle.  \n\nDavey is housetrained (he taught himself to use pee pads too!), and enjoys spending a bit of quiet time in his crate outfitted with blankets, a bed and his toys.\n\nDavey is in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nDavey is 5-6 years old and 6lbs. He's neutered, chipped and vaccinated.  \n\nGrateful Dogs Rescue incurs substantial veterinary and other expenses in rescuing our dogs.  In order to recoup some of these costs, we request a tax-deductible donation for each adoption. The suggested donation for Davey is $150.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Davey, please complete our online adoption application at http://www.gratefuldogsrescue.org/adoption-process.html. One of our volunteers will get back to you. Adoptions are local, confined to the SF Bay Area."

Please see the contact info at the end of this writeup.***\n\nPoor ?Maevis...Maevis is a Bassett Hound/German Shepherd dog mix and is 9-10 years old and weighs about 65 pounds.  All she asks for is some nice walks, a comfortable place to sleep, and a home without small children or other dogs.  Can you foster Maevis?\n\nOverall:  Great and awesome dog.  We hate to give her up for adoption.  We would love to keep her and give her the life she deserves, but we have a one year old son and it is becoming harder and harder to keep them separated, to ensure our child is safe, and give her the proper attention, love, and exercise.\n\nPlease email ctuana@gmail.com if you would like to learn more about Maevis or would like to arrange a time to meet her."

She is a low-key senior pup who loves head scratches, and just wants a warm lap to cuddle up on. She is looking for a calm environment and a loving friend to spend her retirement years with, could that be you? "

                        "$t": "Mama Blue is a nine year old American bulldog, Blue nose pitbull mix who weighs about 70 pounds. She was surrendered by her family because they could no longer take care of her, but she is happily enjoying life in her foster home. As with many pitbull breeds, she does have some skin irritation, and her foster parents are working to get that all healed up in time for her forever home.\n\nMama blue loves to be surrounded by her family or chilling in her favorite spot.She is very affectionate and will come lay her head on your knee or ask for belly rubs.Her ideal home would include a backyard or patio and the company of other fur friends and her family. She is incredibly well behaved and house trained. She knows her basic commands(sit,down, stay) and is working on fetch. She does have some separation anxiety but that has lessened with the help of toys  and treats to keep her entertained as she settles in to her new home. Mama Blue gets along with everyone, including kids, but tends to be shy with other dogs. She is quickly getting used to socializing with dogs but is perfectly happy to be with her human family.\n\nGrateful Dogs Rescue incurs substantial veterinary and other expenses in rescuing our dogs.  In order to recoup some of these costs, we request a tax-deductible donation for each adoption. The suggested donation for Mama Blue is $150.\n\nIf you are interested in adopting Mama Blue, please complete our online adoption application at http://www.gratefuldogsrescue.org/adoption-process.html. One of our volunteers will get back to you. Adoptions are local, confined to the SF Bay Area."

She is a perfectly sweet and mellow companion who would fit right in to any home. Muriel lost one of her eyes (we aren't sure how) and has poor vision in the other, but this doesn't stop her from being friendly, social, and very loyal. She is also great with other dogs!
